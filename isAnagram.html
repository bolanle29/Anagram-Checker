     <!-- Write a program in JavaScript to check if two string are anagrams of each other or not.
    Given two strings "a" and "b", we have to check if they are anagrams of each other or not and return true/false.
    For example;

    Input-1-

    String a = "india"
    String b = "nidia"
    Output - True.

    Explanation - Since the given 'b' contains all the character in the string "a" thus we will return True.

    Input 2 -

    String a = "hackathon"
    String b = "achcthoon"
    Output - False

     Explanation - Since the given string "b" doesn't have all the character as string "a" have thus we will return False. -->
